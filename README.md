**Sentiment Analysis Project**
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project includes a machine learning model for sentiment analysis, its corresponding tokenizer, and a test file to evaluate the model's performance.

**Overview**
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text. This project provides a robust sentiment analysis model along with its tokenizer, enabling users to analyze the sentiment of textual data.

**Components**
Sentiment Analyzer Model (model.pkl): The machine learning model trained to predict sentiment from text data.
Tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl): The tokenizer used to preprocess and tokenize input text for the sentiment analyzer.
Test File (test.py): A Python script for testing the sentiment analysis model with custom input text.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
**Installation**
# Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd sentiment-analysis-project
```

# Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
Run the Test File:
```
python test.py
```
The test.py script will prompt you to enter text and then output the predicted sentiment.

**Example Usage**
```
from sentiment_analyzer import SentimentAnalyzer

# Load the sentiment analyzer model and tokenizer
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer(model_path='model.pkl', tokenizer_path='tokenizer.pkl')

# Predict sentiment for a sample text
input_text = "I love this product! It's amazing."
predicted_sentiment = analyzer.predict_sentiment(input_text)
print("Predicted Sentiment:", predicted_sentiment)
```
